# HtmlTracker
Simplistic Fastr Tracker 2 inspired music tracker for your browser.

Written in TypeScript. Uses jQuery and Vash among other things.

Currently can only produce square waves and will probably not work in Chrome (though I'm sure it can be made to run in it). For now the recommended browser is FireFox.

Your creations can be saved to localStorage (if you move the app to another place on HDD, you won't be able to load previously saved songs).

I tried to keep the tidy code for once, but the editor class is a bit of a monster. Anyway, if you need a tracker for something like Arduino project, modding this app might be easier than writing your own from scratch.
